# AI for Healthcare: A Community-Driven Approach

## Introduction
Welcome to our open-source project, an ambitious endeavor leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to address a pressing healthcare challenge. This project was born out of a personal journey to find innovative solutions for a critical health issue affecting my mother-in-law. We believe in the power of community-driven efforts and the potential of AI to bring about transformative healthcare solutions.

## Objective
Our primary goal is to develop an AI system capable of identifying and addressing advanced adenocarcinoma. This project is not just about one individual's fight against a disease; it's a step towards pioneering a path for AI in personalized healthcare, potentially benefiting many others facing similar challenges.

## How You Can Help
We are reaching out to the global community for support. Whether you are a data scientist, a medical professional, a developer, or someone with insights into AI and healthcare, your contribution can make a significant difference. Here's how you can get involved:
- **Contribute to the Code**: Our project is in its early stages, and we welcome contributions in the form of code, algorithms, or data analysis.
- **Share Knowledge and Resources**: Insights into medical data, AI techniques, or healthcare practices can greatly enhance the project's effectiveness.
- **Spread the Word**: Help us reach a wider audience by sharing our project within your network.

## Funding and Support
To sustain this project, we are considering setting up a crowdfunding campaign, such as GoFundMe or Kickstarter. Details on how to contribute financially will be provided soon. Your support, in any form, is invaluable to us.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your system.

### Set Up the Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Build and Run Using Docker Compose**:
   - Navigate to the project directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
   - Run the following command to build and start the container:
   		- Linux (bash):
		```
   		docker-compose -p ai-med up
   		```
   		- Windows (cmd):

   		open setup.bat file (unc paths aren't supported currently due to limitations of cmd prompt and lack of capabilities from microsoft)

   - This will set up the entire environment, including the installation of necessary Python packages in a virtual environment.

### Activating the Virtual Environment
- Once inside the Docker container, the Python virtual environment will be activated automatically. You can start working with the project immediately.
